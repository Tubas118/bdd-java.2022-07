    * Contains the Acceptance Criteria and BDD Requirements in the README file.
    * Simple example of RED and GREEN commit for endpoint to get single person record.
    
    
* [AC-1.2-bdd-messy](/../AC-1.2-bdd-messy/README.md)
    * Implementation of person "fuzzy search".
    * Example of iterative RED / GREEN commits while finding issues with the "fuzzy search".
    
    
* [AC-1.2-bdd-messy-cleaned-up](/../AC-1.2-bdd-messy-cleaned-up/README.md)
    * Results of using "git rebase" and "git stash" to rewrite the history to one RED and one GREEN commit.
    * End result is exact same code as the final commit of "AC-1.2-bdd-messy".
